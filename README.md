<h1>Hello there! 👋</h1>
<ul>👨‍💻 I'm a 20-year-old Brazilian Computer Engineering undergraduate and full stack developer.<br></ul>
<ul>🌱 My journey in the world of technology began as early as 11 years of age, when I took a 4-year-long programming, game development and robotics course aimed at kids and teens.<br></ul>
<ul>🤖 It allowed me to learn technologies such as C++, C#, PHP, web and database development, and prompted me into choosing Computer Engineering for my graduation.</ul>
<ul>🧠 I have experiences with projects developed utilizing Java and MySQL — whether it's "getting my hands dirty" or leading a team — and I am now working on a Web app using the Flask Python framework.</ul>
<ul>🔒 Most of my projects are actually private though, so I can't show them in public repositories. If you would like to know more about them, message me here or on LinkedIn!</ul>
<ul>⚙️ <b>Current project:</b> an application using the Python Flask framework, which aims to teach about company management through gamification</ul>
