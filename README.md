<h1>Hello there! 👋</h1>
I'm a 20-year-old Brazilian Computer Engineering undergraduate and full stack developer.<br>
My journey in the world of technology began as early as 11 years of age, when I took a 4-year-long programming, game development and robotics course aimed at kids and teens.<br>
It allowed me to learn technologies such as C++, C#, PHP, web and database development, and prompted me into following through into Computer Engineering in college.
<br>
<br>
I have experiences with projects developed utilizing Java and MySQL — whether it's "getting my hands dirty" or leading a team — and I am now working on a Web app using the Flask Python framework.
Most of my projects are actually private though, so I can't show them in public repositories. If you would like to know more about them, message me here or on LinkedIn!
